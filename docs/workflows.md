## Tips

* Most of the modifiers in ScatterSuite utilize curves in one way or another. If you don't have much experience working with curves, it is highly recommended that you first familiarize yourself with them, particularly with BÃ©zier curves

* Modifiers affect the geometry in a sequential order, with the highest modifier in the list applying first and lower modifiers applying to the result of the prior modifier. This means that a change in the order of modifiers can have a large impact on the end result. For example, placing [Curve to Curves](curve_generation/curves_to_curves.md) first and [Align Curves to Surface](curve_manipulation/align_curve_to_surface.md) second will cause the subcurves generated by **Curve to Curves** to align with the surface, while the reverse order will only align the curve used for the generation of the subcurves
